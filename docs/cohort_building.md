# Cohort Building with OHDSI WebAPI

This guide explains how to create cohorts programmatically using the OHDSI WebAPI, including incremental filtering and getting counts at each step.

## Overview

OHDSI cohorts are defined using a JSON expression that specifies:
1. **Initial Events** - What qualifies someone for entry into the cohort
2. **Inclusion Criteria** - Additional rules that must be met
3. **Cohort Exit** - When someone leaves the cohort
4. **Censoring** - Rules for observation period requirements

## Basic Cohort Structure

A cohort definition consists of:
- **ConceptSets**: Reusable groups of medical concepts
- **PrimaryCriteria**: Initial qualifying events
- **InclusionRules**: Additional filtering criteria
- **EndStrategy**: How/when the cohort period ends
- **CensoringCriteria**: Observation period requirements

## Example: Males over 40 with Diabetes

Here's how you'd build a cohort for "males over 40 who have had diabetes in the last 2 years":

```python
# 1. Define concept sets for diabetes
diabetes_concepts = {
    "id": 0,
    "name": "Type 2 Diabetes",
    "expression": {
        "items": [
            {
                "concept": {
                    "conceptId": 201826,  # Type 2 diabetes mellitus
                    "conceptName": "Type 2 diabetes mellitus",
                    "standardConcept": "S",
                    "conceptCode": "44054006",
                    "conceptClassId": "Clinical Finding",
                    "vocabularyId": "SNOMED",
                    "domainId": "Condition"
                },
                "includeDescendants": True,
                "includeMapped": False,
                "isExcluded": False
            }
        ]
    }
}

# 2. Build the cohort definition
cohort_expression = {
    "conceptSets": [diabetes_concepts],
    "primaryCriteria": {
        "criteriaList": [
            {
                "conditionOccurrence": {
                    "conceptSetId": 0,  # References diabetes concept set
                    "conditionType": [
                        {
                            "conceptId": 32020,  # EHR Chief Complaint
                            "conceptName": "EHR Chief Complaint"
                        }
                    ]

```

## Incremental Filtering & Counts

To see counts as you add each filter incrementally, you can:

1. **Create base cohort** (just the primary criteria)
2. **Add inclusion rules one by one** 
3. **Generate and check counts** after each addition

```python
async def build_cohort_incrementally(client, source_key: str):
    """Build a cohort step by step, showing counts at each stage"""
    
    # Step 1: Base cohort (diabetes diagnosis)
    base_cohort = CohortDefinition(
        name="Step 1: Diabetes diagnosis",
        expression=create_base_expression()  # Just primary criteria
    )
    
    cohort1 = await client.cohorts.create(base_cohort)
    await client.cohorts.generate(cohort1.id, source_key)
    status1 = await client.cohorts.poll_generation(cohort1.id, source_key)
    counts1 = await client.cohorts.counts(cohort1.id)
    print(f"Step 1 - Diabetes patients: {counts1[0].subject_count if counts1 else 0}")
    
    # Step 2: Add male gender filter
    male_cohort = CohortDefinition(
        name="Step 2: Male + Diabetes",
        expression=add_male_filter(base_cohort.expression)
    )
    
    cohort2 = await client.cohorts.create(male_cohort)
    await client.cohorts.generate(cohort2.id, source_key)
    status2 = await client.cohorts.poll_generation(cohort2.id, source_key)
    counts2 = await client.cohorts.counts(cohort2.id)
    print(f"Step 2 - Male diabetes patients: {counts2[0].subject_count if counts2 else 0}")
    
    # Step 3: Add age filter
    age_cohort = CohortDefinition(
        name="Step 3: Male + Age 40+ + Diabetes",
        expression=add_age_filter(male_cohort.expression)
    )
    
    cohort3 = await client.cohorts.create(age_cohort)
    await client.cohorts.generate(cohort3.id, source_key)
    status3 = await client.cohorts.poll_generation(cohort3.id, source_key)
    counts3 = await client.cohorts.counts(cohort3.id)
    print(f"Step 3 - Male 40+ diabetes patients: {counts3[0].subject_count if counts3 else 0}")
    
    # Get detailed inclusion rule statistics
    inclusion_stats = await client.cohorts.inclusion_rules(cohort3.id, source_key)
    for rule in inclusion_stats:
        print(f"Inclusion rule '{rule.name}': {rule.person_count} people")
    
    return cohort3
```

## Key Concepts

### Concept Sets
- Reusable groups of medical concepts (conditions, drugs, procedures)
- Can include descendant concepts (e.g., all types of diabetes)
- Reference OMOP standardized vocabularies

### Primary Criteria
- Defines the "index event" that qualifies someone for the cohort
- Usually a condition, drug exposure, procedure, etc.
- Sets the "index date" for each person

### Inclusion Rules
- Additional criteria that must be met
- Applied as filters after the primary criteria
- Can reference demographics, time windows, concept occurrences

### Time Windows
- Relative to the index date
- Negative coefficients = before index date
- Positive coefficients = after index date
- Used for "in the last X years" type criteria

## Common Patterns

### Demographics
```python
# Male gender
"person": {
    "genderConcept": [{"conceptId": 8507}]  # 8532 for Female
}

# Age at index date
"person": {
    "ageAtStart": {"value": 40, "op": "gte"}  # >= 40 years old
}
```

### Time-based Conditions
```python
# Condition in last 2 years before index
"startWindow": {
    "start": {"coeff": -730},  # 2 years before
    "end": {"coeff": 0}        # index date
}
```

### Multiple Conditions
```python
# Must have BOTH condition A AND condition B
"type": "ALL",
"criteriaList": [condition_a_criteria, condition_b_criteria]

# Must have EITHER condition A OR condition B  
"type": "ANY",
"criteriaList": [condition_a_criteria, condition_b_criteria]
```

This approach gives you fine-grained control over cohort building and lets you see exactly how each filter affects your population size.

## Simple Example: Quick Incremental Cohort Building

For most use cases, you can use our simplified helper methods instead of building the complex JSON structures manually:

```python
from ohdsi_webapi import OHDSIWebAPIClient

async def example_incremental_cohort():
    """Example: Males over 40 with diabetes in last 2 years"""
    
    client = OHDSIWebAPIClient()
    
    # Get your data source
    sources = await client.sources.list()
    source_key = sources[0].source_key  # Use first available source
    
    # Define what we're looking for
    diabetes_cs = client.cohorts.create_concept_set(201826, "Type 2 Diabetes")
    
    # Define filters to apply incrementally
    filters = [
        {"type": "gender", "gender": "male", "name": "Male"},
        {"type": "age", "min_age": 40, "name": "Age 40+"},
        {"type": "time_window", "concept_set_id": 0, "days_before": 730, 
         "filter_name": "Diabetes in last 2 years"}
    ]
    
    # Build cohort step by step - this does all the work!
    results = await client.cohorts.build_incremental_cohort(
        source_key=source_key,
        base_name="Diabetes Study",
        concept_sets=[diabetes_cs], 
        filters=filters
    )
    
    # See counts at each step
    print("📊 Cohort Building Results:")
    for i, (cohort, count) in enumerate(results):
        print(f"Step {i+1}: {count:,} patients - {cohort.name}")
        
        if i > 0:
            prev_count = results[i-1][1]
            reduction = prev_count - count
            pct_reduction = (reduction / prev_count * 100) if prev_count > 0 else 0
            print(f"  Reduction: -{reduction:,} patients (-{pct_reduction:.1f}%)")
    
    return results[-1][0]  # Return final cohort

# Example output:
# Step 1: 45,230 patients - All diabetes patients
# Step 2: 23,115 patients - Male diabetes patients
#   Reduction: -22,115 patients (-48.9%)
# Step 3: 18,492 patients - Male diabetes patients 40+  
#   Reduction: -4,623 patients (-20.0%)
# Step 4: 12,847 patients - Male diabetes patients 40+ (last 2 years)
#   Reduction: -5,645 patients (-30.5%)
```

This gives you exactly what you need:
- **Incremental filtering** with counts at each step
- **Clear impact** of each filter on population size  
- **Automated cohort creation** without complex JSON structures
- **Real patient counts** from your actual data source

Much simpler than building the JSON expressions manually!

## Exclusion Criteria

In addition to inclusion criteria, ATLAS cohorts support **exclusion criteria** to remove patients who meet certain conditions. This is essential for creating clinically relevant cohorts.

### Common Exclusion Use Cases

1. **Cancer History** - Exclude patients with cancer for cardiac studies
2. **Pregnancy** - Exclude pregnant women from certain studies  
3. **Recent Procedures** - Exclude patients with recent surgeries
4. **Contraindicated Medications** - Exclude patients on specific drugs
5. **Early Death** - Exclude patients who died shortly after index date

### Adding Exclusion Criteria

```python
# Base cohort for heart failure patients
heart_failure_cs = client.cohorts.create_concept_set(444094, "Heart Failure")
cancer_cs = client.cohorts.create_concept_set(443392, "Cancer", include_descendants=True)

concept_sets = [heart_failure_cs, cancer_cs]
base_expression = client.cohorts.create_base_cohort_expression(concept_sets)

# Add exclusion: No cancer in last 5 years
excluded_expression = client.cohorts.add_exclusion_condition(
    base_expression,
    concept_set_id=1,  # Cancer concept set
    days_before=1825,  # 5 years before index
    exclusion_name="No cancer history (5 years)"
)

# Add exclusion: No chemotherapy in last year  
final_expression = client.cohorts.add_exclusion_drug(
    excluded_expression,
    concept_set_id=2,  # Chemotherapy drugs
    days_before=365,   # 1 year
    exclusion_name="No recent chemotherapy"
)
```

### Types of Exclusions

#### 1. Condition Exclusions
```python
# Exclude patients with specific medical conditions
expression = client.cohorts.add_exclusion_condition(
    expression,
    concept_set_id=1,
    days_before=365,  # Look back 1 year
    exclusion_name="No cancer history"
)
```

#### 2. Drug Exclusions
```python
# Exclude patients taking certain medications
expression = client.cohorts.add_exclusion_drug(
    expression, 
    concept_set_id=2,
    days_before=90,   # Look back 90 days
    exclusion_name="No contraindicated meds"
)
```

#### 3. Procedure Exclusions
```python
# Exclude patients with recent procedures
expression = client.cohorts.add_exclusion_procedure(
    expression,
    concept_set_id=3, 
    days_before=180,  # Look back 6 months
    exclusion_name="No recent surgery"
)
```

#### 4. Death Exclusions
```python
# Exclude patients who died early (for outcome studies)
expression = client.cohorts.add_exclusion_death(
    expression,
    days_after_index=30  # Must survive 30 days
)
```

        step_name = cohort.name.split(" - ")[-1]
        print(f"Step {i+1}: {count:,} patients - {step_name}")
        
        if i > 0:
            prev_count = results[i-1][1]
            if "Exclude" in step_name:
                excluded = prev_count - count  
                print(f"  → {excluded:,} patients excluded")
            else:
                filtered = prev_count - count
                print(f"  → {filtered:,} patients filtered")
    
    return results[-1][0]  # Final cohort

# Example output:
# Step 1: 45,230 patients - Base criteria
# Step 2: 23,115 patients - Male patients
#   → 22,115 patients filtered
# Step 3: 18,492 patients - Age 18-80
#   → 4,623 patients filtered  
# Step 4: 12,847 patients - Heart failure in last year
#   → 5,645 patients filtered
# Step 5: 11,203 patients - Exclude No cancer history (5 years)
#   → 1,644 patients excluded
# Step 6: 10,887 patients - Exclude No chemotherapy (1 year)  
#   → 316 patients excluded
# Step 7: 10,156 patients - Exclude No recent cardiac surgery
#   → 731 patients excluded
# Step 8: 9,834 patients - Exclude Survived at least 30 days
#   → 322 patients excluded
```

### Exclusion vs Inclusion Logic

**Inclusion Rules** (AND logic):
- Patient MUST meet all inclusion criteria
- Used for: Demographics, required conditions, time windows

**Exclusion Criteria** (NOT logic):  
- Patient must NOT have any exclusion conditions
- Used for: Contraindications, competing conditions, early outcomes

### Best Practices for Exclusions

1. **Apply exclusions last** - Include first, then exclude to see the impact
2. **Use appropriate time windows** - Cancer history = 5 years, recent surgery = 6 months
3. **Document clinical rationale** - Why are you excluding each condition?
4. **Consider competing risks** - Death exclusions for outcome studies
5. **Test sensitivity** - Try different exclusion windows to see impact
6. **Balance precision vs power** - Too many exclusions = small cohorts

This approach gives you the full power of ATLAS cohort definitions - precisely defining both who you want (inclusions) and who you don't want (exclusions) in your study population.

## Advanced Filter Types

Beyond basic demographics and conditions, the cohort builder supports advanced clinical filters for sophisticated study designs:

### Data Quality & Enrollment Filters

#### Observation Period Requirements
Ensure patients have continuous health data coverage:

```python
# Require 1 year of prior data and 6 months of follow-up
expression = client.cohorts.add_observation_period_filter(
    expression,
    days_before=365,    # 1 year of prior data
    days_after=180,     # 6 months of follow-up data
    filter_name="Continuous enrollment (1yr prior, 6mo follow-up)"
)
```

#### Prior Observation Requirements  
Ensure minimum data history for baseline characterization:

```python
# Require at least 2 years of prior observation
expression = client.cohorts.add_prior_observation_filter(
    expression,
    min_days=730,  # 2 years
    filter_name="Minimum 2 years prior data"
)
```

### Healthcare Utilization Filters

#### Visit Type Requirements
Filter by type of healthcare encounter:

```python
# Common visit types (use OMOP concept IDs)
VISIT_TYPES = {
    9201: "Inpatient visit",
    9202: "Outpatient visit", 
    9203: "Emergency room visit",
    9204: "Intensive care",
    8717: "Telehealth visit"
}

# Require outpatient visit in last 90 days
expression = client.cohorts.add_visit_filter(
    expression,
    visit_concept_ids=[9202],  # Outpatient
    days_before=90,
    filter_name="Outpatient visit in last 90 days"
)

# Require either inpatient OR ER visit in last 30 days
expression = client.cohorts.add_visit_filter(
    expression,
    visit_concept_ids=[9201, 9203],  # Inpatient OR ER
    days_before=30,
    filter_name="Hospital or ER visit in last 30 days"
)
```

### Laboratory & Measurement Filters

#### Lab Value Requirements
Filter by specific lab results and value ranges:

```python
# HbA1c between 7-10% in last 6 months
hba1c_cs = client.cohorts.create_concept_set(3655963, "Hemoglobin A1c")
expression = client.cohorts.add_measurement_filter(
    expression,
    concept_set_id=1,  # HbA1c concept set index
    value_min=7.0,
    value_max=10.0,
    days_before=180,   # Last 6 months
    filter_name="HbA1c 7-10% (last 6 months)"
)

# LDL cholesterol > 100 mg/dL
ldl_cs = client.cohorts.create_concept_set(3004249, "LDL Cholesterol")
expression = client.cohorts.add_measurement_filter(
    expression,
    concept_set_id=2,
    value_min=100.0,   # No upper limit
    days_before=365,
    filter_name="LDL > 100 mg/dL (last year)"
)

# Blood pressure measurements (any value) 
bp_cs = client.cohorts.create_concept_set(3027018, "Systolic Blood Pressure")
expression = client.cohorts.add_measurement_filter(
    expression,
    concept_set_id=3,
    # No value limits - just require measurement exists
    days_before=90,
    filter_name="BP measurement in last 90 days"
)
```

#### Common Lab Value Examples

```python
# Diabetes monitoring labs
HBA1C_RANGES = {
    "controlled": (0, 7.0),      # < 7%
    "moderate": (7.0, 9.0),      # 7-9%  
    "uncontrolled": (9.0, None)  # > 9%
}

# Kidney function
EGFR_STAGES = {
    "normal": (90, None),        # ≥ 90 mL/min/1.73m²
    "mild_ckd": (60, 89),        # 60-89 
    "moderate_ckd": (30, 59),    # 30-59
    "severe_ckd": (15, 29),      # 15-29
    "kidney_failure": (0, 14)    # < 15
}

# Lipid management
CHOLESTEROL_TARGETS = {
    "ldl_high_risk": (0, 70),    # < 70 mg/dL for high risk
    "ldl_moderate": (70, 100),   # 70-100 mg/dL
    "ldl_elevated": (100, None)  # > 100 mg/dL
}
```

### Medication Usage Filters

#### Drug Era Requirements
Filter by continuous medication exposure periods:

```python
# Metformin for at least 90 days in last year
metformin_cs = client.cohorts.create_concept_set(1502826, "Metformin")
expression = client.cohorts.add_drug_era_filter(
    expression,
    concept_set_id=4,           # Metformin concept set
    era_length_min=90,          # At least 90 days continuous
    days_before=365,            # Within last year
    filter_name="Metformin ≥90 days (last year)"
)

# Any statin for at least 180 days
statin_cs = client.cohorts.create_concept_set(1539403, "Statin", include_descendants=True)
expression = client.cohorts.add_drug_era_filter(
    expression, 
    concept_set_id=5,
    era_length_min=180,         # 6 months minimum
    days_before=730,            # Within last 2 years
    filter_name="Statin therapy ≥180 days"
)

# No minimum duration - just any exposure
ace_inhibitor_cs = client.cohorts.create_concept_set(1308216, "ACE Inhibitors", True)
expression = client.cohorts.add_drug_era_filter(
    expression,
    concept_set_id=6,
    # era_length_min not specified = any duration
    days_before=90,
    filter_name="ACE inhibitor in last 90 days"
)
```

### Complex Logic Filters

#### Multiple Conditions Requirements
Apply ALL or ANY logic across multiple conditions:

```python
# Must have BOTH hypertension AND diabetes
hypertension_cs = client.cohorts.create_concept_set(316866, "Hypertensive disease")
diabetes_cs = client.cohorts.create_concept_set(201826, "Type 2 diabetes")

expression = client.cohorts.add_multiple_conditions_filter(
    expression,
    concept_set_ids=[7, 8],  # Hypertension and diabetes concept sets
    logic="ALL",             # Must have BOTH conditions
    days_before=1095,        # Within last 3 years
    filter_name="Hypertension AND diabetes (last 3 years)"
)

# Must have ANY cardiovascular condition
mi_cs = client.cohorts.create_concept_set(4329847, "Myocardial infarction")
stroke_cs = client.cohorts.create_concept_set(381591, "Cerebrovascular accident")
hf_cs = client.cohorts.create_concept_set(444094, "Heart failure")

expression = client.cohorts.add_multiple_conditions_filter(
    expression,
    concept_set_ids=[9, 10, 11],  # MI, stroke, or HF
    logic="ANY",                  # Just need ONE of these
    days_before=1825,             # Within last 5 years
    filter_name="Any major CVD event (last 5 years)"
)
```

### Real-World Clinical Study Example

```python
async def comprehensive_diabetes_study():
    """Real-world example combining all filter types"""
    
    client = WebApiClient()
    
    # Define all concept sets needed
    concept_sets = [
        client.cohorts.create_concept_set(201826, "Type 2 Diabetes"),      # 0
        client.cohorts.create_concept_set(3655963, "Hemoglobin A1c"),      # 1
        client.cohorts.create_concept_set(1502826, "Metformin"),           # 2
        client.cohorts.create_concept_set(316866, "Hypertensive disease"), # 3
        client.cohorts.create_concept_set(314666, "Chronic kidney disease"),# 4
        client.cohorts.create_concept_set(443392, "Malignant neoplasm")    # 5 - Cancer
    ]
    
    # Inclusion criteria (what we want)
    inclusion_filters = [
        # Demographics & data quality
        {"type": "age", "min_age": 40, "max_age": 75, "name": "Age 40-75"},

        # Comorbidity requirements  
        {"type": "multiple_conditions", "concept_set_ids": [3, 4], "logic": "ALL",
         "days_before": 1095, "filter_name": "Hypertension AND kidney disease"}
    ]
    
    # Exclusion criteria (what we don't want)
    exclusions = [
        {"type": "condition", "concept_set_id": 5, "days_before": 1825,
         "name": "No cancer history (5 years)"},
        {"type": "death", "days_after_index": 30, 
         "name": "Survived ≥30 days"}
    ]
    
    # Build comprehensive cohort
    results = await client.cohorts.build_incremental_cohort(
        source_key="your_source",
        base_name="Comprehensive Diabetes Study",
        concept_sets=concept_sets,
        filters=inclusion_filters,
        exclusions=exclusions
    )
    
    return results
```

### Advanced Filter Reference

| Filter Type | Purpose | Key Parameters | Example Use Case |
|-------------|---------|----------------|------------------|
| `observation_period` | Data continuity | `days_before`, `days_after` | Ensure 1yr baseline + 6mo follow-up |
| `prior_observation` | Data quality | `min_days` | Require 2+ years of health records |
| `visit` | Care utilization | `visit_concept_ids`, `days_before` | Recent outpatient engagement |
| `measurement` | Lab values | `value_min`, `value_max`, `days_before` | HbA1c 7-10% in last 6 months |
| `drug_era` | Medication adherence | `era_length_min`, `days_before` | Metformin for 90+ days |
| `multiple_conditions` | Complex comorbidity | `concept_set_ids`, `logic` | Diabetes AND hypertension |

These advanced filters enable creation of clinically sophisticated cohorts that match real-world research study inclusion/exclusion criteria. They're essential for pragmatic clinical trials, comparative effectiveness research, and quality improvement studies.

## Handling Broad Medical Terms

### The Challenge: "Cardiovascular Disease"

When users ask for broad terms like "cardiovascular disease", "diabetes", or "cancer", these can match dozens or hundreds of specific conditions. Here's how to handle this systematically:

#### 1. Search and Explore First

```python
async def explore_cardiovascular_concepts():
    """Explore what 'cardiovascular disease' actually includes"""
    
    client = OHDSIWebAPIClient()
    
    # Search for cardiovascular concepts
    cvd_concepts = await client.vocabulary.search("cardiovascular disease")
    
    print(f"Found {len(cvd_concepts)} concepts for 'cardiovascular disease':")
    for concept in cvd_concepts[:10]:  # Show first 10
        print(f"  {concept.concept_id}: {concept.concept_name}")
        print(f"    Domain: {concept.domainId}, Standard: {concept.standardConcept}")
    
    # Look for high-level parent concepts
    high_level = [c for c in cvd_concepts if "disease" in c.concept_name.lower() 
                  and len(c.concept_name.split()) <= 4]
    
    print(f"\nHigh-level CVD concepts ({len(high_level)}):")
    for concept in high_level:
        print(f"  {concept.concept_id}: {concept.concept_name}")
        
        # Check descendants to see scope
        descendants = await client.vocabulary.descendants(concept.concept_id)
        print(f"    → {len(descendants)} descendant conditions")

# Example output:
# Found 247 concepts for 'cardiovascular disease'
#   194990: Cardiovascular disease
#     Domain: Condition, Standard: S
#     → 1,247 descendant conditions
#   313217: Hypertensive heart disease  
#     Domain: Condition, Standard: S
#     → 23 descendant conditions
```

#### 2. Let Users Choose Specificity

```python
async def build_cvd_cohort_with_options():
    """Give users multiple options for cardiovascular disease"""
    
    client = OHDSIWebAPIClient()
    
    # Option 1: Very broad - all cardiovascular disease
    broad_cvd = client.cohorts.create_concept_set(
        concept_id=194990,  # "Cardiovascular disease" 
        name="All Cardiovascular Disease",
        include_descendants=True  # Includes ALL subtypes
    )
    
    # Option 2: Specific conditions only
    specific_conditions = [
        (4329847, "Myocardial infarction"),
        (381591, "Cerebrovascular accident"), 
        (4110056, "Chronic ischemic heart disease"),
        (316866, "Hypertensive heart disease")
    ]
    
    # Create separate concept sets for each
    specific_concept_sets = []
    for concept_id, name in specific_conditions:
        cs = client.cohorts.create_concept_set(concept_id, name, include_descendants=True)
        specific_concept_sets.append(cs)
    
    # Option 3: Let user see counts for different approaches
    sources = await client.sources.list()
    source_key = sources[0].source_key
    
    print("🔍 Cardiovascular Disease Cohort Options:")
    print("=" * 50)
    
    # Test broad approach
    broad_filters = [{"type": "gender", "gender": "male"}, {"type": "age", "min_age": 40}]
    broad_results = await client.cohorts.build_incremental_cohort(
        source_key=source_key,
        base_name="Broad CVD (All types)",
        concept_sets=[broad_cvd],
        filters=broad_filters
    )
    
    print(f"📊 BROAD: All CVD types → {broad_results[-1][1]:,} patients")
    
    # Test specific approach
    for i, (cs, (concept_id, name)) in enumerate(zip(specific_concept_sets, specific_conditions)):
        specific_results = await client.cohorts.build_incremental_cohort(
            source_key=source_key,
            base_name=f"Specific: {name}",
            concept_sets=[cs],
            filters=broad_filters
        )
        print(f"📊 SPECIFIC: {name} → {specific_results[-1][1]:,} patients")
    
    return broad_results, specific_concept_sets
```

#### 3. Interactive Concept Set Builder

```python
async def interactive_concept_explorer(search_term: str):
    """Help users interactively build concept sets"""
    
    client = OHDSIWebAPIClient()
    
    print(f"🔍 Exploring: '{search_term}'")
    print("=" * 40)
    
    # 1. Search for concepts
    concepts = await client.vocabulary.search(search_term)
    
    # 2. Group by domain and standard status
    domains = {}
    for concept in concepts:
        domain = concept.domainId
        if domain not in domains:
            domains[domain] = []
        domains[domain].append(concept)
    
    print("📋 Found concepts by domain:")
    for domain, domain_concepts in domains.items():
        standard = [c for c in domain_concepts if c.standardConcept == 'S']
        print(f"  {domain}: {len(standard)} standard concepts")
    
    # 3. Show top-level concepts (likely parents)
    condition_concepts = domains.get('Condition', [])
    standard_conditions = [c for c in condition_concepts if c.standardConcept == 'S']
    
    print(f"\n🎯 Top condition concepts for '{search_term}':")
    for i, concept in enumerate(standard_conditions[:10]):
        descendants = await client.vocabulary.descendants(concept.concept_id)
        print(f"  {i+1}. {concept.concept_name} (ID: {concept.concept_id})")
        print(f"     → Includes {len(descendants)} specific conditions")
        
        # Show a few examples
        if descendants:
            examples = descendants[:3]
            example_names = [d.concept_name for d in examples]
            print(f"     → Examples: {', '.join(example_names)}")
            if len(descendants) > 3:
                print(f"     → ...and {len(descendants) - 3} more")
        print()
    
    return standard_conditions

# Usage:
# concepts = await interactive_concept_explorer("cardiovascular disease")
# concepts = await interactive_concept_explorer("diabetes") 
# concepts = await interactive_concept_explorer("cancer")
```

#### 4. Concept Set Validation

```python
async def validate_concept_set_size(concept_id: int, source_key: str):
    """Check how many patients a concept set would include"""
    
    client = OHDSIWebAPIClient()
    
    # Create test concept set
    test_cs = client.cohorts.create_concept_set(concept_id, "Test Concept Set")
    
    # Create minimal cohort to get counts
    test_cohort = CohortDefinition(
        name="Concept Set Size Test",
        expression=client.cohorts.create_base_cohort_expression([test_cs])
    )
    
    # Generate and get counts
    created = await client.cohorts.create(test_cohort)
    await client.cohorts.generate(created.id, source_key)
    await client.cohorts.poll_generation(created.id, source_key)
    counts = await client.cohorts.counts(created.id)
    
    patient_count = counts[0].subject_count if counts else 0
    
    # Clean up test cohort
    await client.cohorts.delete(created.id)
    
    return patient_count

async def suggest_concept_refinement(search_term: str, source_key: str):
    """Suggest concept refinements based on patient counts"""
    
    concepts = await interactive_concept_explorer(search_term)
    
    print(f"\n📊 Patient counts for different '{search_term}' definitions:")
    print("-" * 60)
    
    for concept in concepts[:5]:  # Test top 5 concepts
        try:
            count = await validate_concept_set_size(concept.concept_id, source_key)
            print(f"{concept.concept_name:40} → {count:,} patients")
            
            # Suggest based on size
            if count > 100000:
                print(f"  ⚠️  Very broad - consider more specific subtypes")
            elif count < 100:
                print(f"  ⚠️  Very narrow - consider broader category")
            else:
                print(f"  ✓  Good size for analysis")
                
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"{concept.concept_name:40} → Error: {e}")
        
        print()
```

### Best Practices for Broad Terms

1. **Always explore first** - Search and show users what concepts are available, with descendant counts
2. **Show options** - Give users both broad and specific alternatives with patient counts  
3. **Validate sizes** - Show actual patient counts for different concept definitions
4. **Document choices** - Record which concepts were included/excluded and why
5. **Iterative refinement** - Start broad, then narrow based on clinical input

This approach helps users make informed decisions about concept selection rather than blindly using overly broad or narrow definitions.

### Real Examples:

*  "Cardiovascular disease" → Could be 1 broad concept (194990) with 1,247 descendants, OR 4 specific conditions
* "Diabetes" → Type 1, Type 2, gestational, secondary diabetes all very different
* "Cancer" → Hundreds of specific cancer types with very different characteristics


#### The Solution:

Instead of guessing what the user wants, the API helps them:

- See all options with patient counts
- Compare broad vs specific approaches
- Make informed decisions about scope
- Iteratively refine their cohort definition


This is a much better approach than either:
